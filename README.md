# CurrencyExchange
A Python script for showing the exchange rate between two currrencies

The purpose of this script was for me to practice python and working with REST APIs.
My goals:
    *Expanding my pythong knowledge
    *Learn about working with REST APIs
    *Learn about handling unexpected input

Use cases:
    *Take user input of a country code and verify that it exists in the API
    *Take user input of a second country code and validate it
    *Give user an option to display the available country codes
    *Handle the case of the user input
    *Take the two inputs and display the conversion rate between their crespective currencies
    *Handle malformed input gracefully
    *Handle invalid country codes gracefully
    *Handle HTTP response errors
